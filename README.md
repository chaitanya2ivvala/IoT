# IoT
The System is the combination of three completely different fields viz.
embedded system, image process and wireless networking for IoT. 
1)System consists of clusters of sensors, grouping differing kinds of information, concerning the sphere. The info transmission of sensible sensing devices connected with Zigbee network and these infoemation is transferrde to cloud by using plotly API. 
2)Image Processing techniques are used for the diseased leaf detection K-means clustering and Otsu Threshold Algorithm is the image segmentation techniques used to detect the diseased leaf and GLSM is used for acquiring the data of the diseased leaf and by using neural networks to differentiate the diseased leaf and healthy leaf
